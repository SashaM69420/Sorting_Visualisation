# Sorting_Visualisation
First try at building a GUI Project

This project is an attempt to visualize different sorting algorithms using tkinter
You can see the working demo here:

# Further work:
It was just a rookie attempt at the project and hence would love to hear any optimisations that can be made.
Also, would love to add other sorting algorithms like merge sort and quick sort as well

* Head over to issues to contribute. Any help is appreciated *
